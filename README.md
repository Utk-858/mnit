# MNIT React Hack-A-Thon Project

This project is a React web application designed for the 2024 MNIT Hack-A-Thon. It showcases various components using modern front-end technologies like Vite, React, TailwindCSS, and ESLint. Additionally, the project incorporates an AI/ML component to generate fake freelancer data and cluster them for optimal team selection based on project requirements. The system uses KMeans clustering to recommend the best teams based on role, budget, and duration.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shulinagarwal/mnit
cd mnit
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server, and you can view the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Set up Python Backend (AI/ML Components)

1. Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Python script to generate fake freelancer data and apply clustering:
   ```bash
   python generate_teams.py
   ```

4. Modify the script to generate team recommendations as per your requirements.

## Usage

### Routes

- **Home Page**: The main page of the application with various sections like Reviews, Page, Excite, Slogan, and Footer.
- **Jobs Page**: A separate page dedicated to showcasing job listings.

### AI/ML Team Recommendations

The AI/ML component helps in selecting the best freelance team based on the following:
- **Freelancer data**: Fake data is generated for freelancers, including their role, skills, and performance.
- **Clustering**: KMeans clustering is applied to group freelancers based on skill proficiency, performance score, and hourly rate.
- **Team selection**: The algorithm recommends the best, second-best, and third-best teams based on the available budget and project duration.

## Technologies Used
- **Figma**: A web-based UI/UX design tool used to create visual and interactive designs. The user interface for this project was designed in Figma, ensuring an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides fast, efficient development with React.
- **TailwindCSS**: A utility-first CSS framework to create modern, responsive designs.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
- **React Router**: A library for handling routing in React applications.
- **Expo Google Fonts**: A library for using Google Fonts with Expo.
- **Autoprefixer**: A tool to automatically add vendor prefixes to CSS.
- **Python**: For backend processing, generating fake freelancer data, and applying AI/ML clustering.
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and creating data frames.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models like KMeans clustering and data scaling.
- **faker**: For generating fake freelancer data.
- **StandardScaler**: For normalizing data before applying machine learning techniques.

## AI/ML and Toolkit Used

### AI/ML Techniques:
- **KMeans Clustering**: Used to categorize freelancers into clusters based on their skills, performance, and experience. The best teams are selected by considering both the role and cluster characteristics.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Features like skill proficiency, performance score, and hourly rate are standardized using `StandardScaler` to improve clustering accuracy.
- **Team Selection Algorithm**: Based on the budget, role requirements, and project duration, the algorithm recommends the best freelancers for the team.

### Toolkit Used:
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For handling data and creating data frames
  - `faker`: For generating fake freelancer data
  - `scikit-learn`: For machine learning models like KMeans clustering and data scaling
  - `StandardScaler`: For normalizing data before applying machine learning techniques
